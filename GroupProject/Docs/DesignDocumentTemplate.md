## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions
- The system assumes that users will input accurate and complete information regarding job offers and comparison settings.
- It assumes stable network connectivity for fetching additional data if needed.
### 1.2 Constraints
- The system must be designed to handle different types of job offers with varying attributes.
- It should consider scalability for potential future enhancements or increased user load.

### 1.3 System Environment
- Hardware: Standard computing devices (PCs, laptops, smartphones) with internet connectivity.
- Software: Compatible with modern web browsers and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
